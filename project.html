							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p align="justify"> I created this web site in a simple and clear way with the objective to do a better publicity and a better way to book the services of Arelu Terapias, that is a business facing holistic therapies. I chose to work with a template easy and really visual as this was the demand of the owners. The site provides a painel with all the information of the services that we offer, besides the menu, include the contact area and the about us page. Therefore, the site aims to enclose all the useful information of Arelu Terapias in a single space.</p>

							<h2>STRATEGY COMMUNICATION </h2>
							<h2>1.Background</h2>
							<p align="justify"> We can find a lot of competitors in the holistic therapies area, specially in the city of Jundiaí-Sao Paolo still, we have some points that make us different from the others. The first one is that we are the first place for holistic therapy in the neighborhood and the second, thinking about the website, is that we have a practical and easy design, which leaves the clients without doubts about our services, he/she could find all the necessary information in only one place.</p>
							<h2>2.Communicative goals</h2>
							<p align="justify"> With the creation of this website I wanted to equip Arelu Terapias with something more than the competitors have to offer. The communication goals are mostly informative: the site explains to its users what the services that Arelu Terapias has to offer. The site is created in a simple and effective way: it allows direct and easy navigation with clear, original and nice contents. I made these choices to try to reach as many people as possible. The site, therefore, has as its main purpose to advertise and increase the public of Arelu Terapias, thanks to the clear information on the site; we want to retain users who already know us and also reach all those users who don’t know us yet. </p>
							<h2>3.Target Audience and message </h2>
							<p align="justify"> The primary target is made up of anyone who likes holistic treatment, such as the services that we offer. The secondary target is made up of everyone that is looking for a more natural and calm way of life, as much as a new health lifestyle. 
							<p align="justify"> The main target is reached via social networks (Facebook and Instagram) and from the word from people to people (especially via WhatsApp). What can certainly help me reach this target are: the simplicity of the site, the originality of the content, but above all the promotion of Arelu Terapias on social media. The message that we want to pass to clients and visitors of the website is that more than anything we cherish their health and well-being.</p>
							<h2>4.Promotion and evaluation of results</h2>
							<p align="justify"> The site was advertised through Whatsapp and Instagram:  we used the Stories tool on Instagram to published the website and also, the link was sent and shared by a lot of people thanks to Whatsapp. The evaluation consisted of at least 50 visits from users; the measurement was performed with the use of Google Analytics.</p>
